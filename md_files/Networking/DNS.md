# DNS

Domain Name System - translates human readable domain/host names to IP addresses.

- Domain Name - ex. saramet.de, a human language representation of a server (IP) address.
- IP Address - a machine language representation of a computer address used to interact between them using a network protocol named TCP/IP. An IPv4 address is a combination of 4 octets separated by dots. An octet is basically 8 bits. Therefore there are 32 bits totally. It is represented in decimal numbers from 0 to 255, so it looks something like: 192.134.111.12
- DNS - a "middle-man" that translates human readable address to machine readable IP address. It's harder to remember a bunch of numbers instead of words. But if you can do it, you can use IPs directly avoiding the DNS.

## Terminology

- **TLD, Top Level Domain** - ex. `.com`, `.org`, `.net`. It's the tail, the ending, of the domain name.

- **SLD, Second Level Domain** - ex. `saramet` in `saramet.de`. The actual name of the domain name. It can contain any alphanumeric characters [a-z,0-9], dashes (-) or underscores (_).

- **A-Records, Address Records** -

- **CNAME Records, Canonical Domain Records** - used to includes sub-domains and Aliases

  - **Sub-Domain, Third Level Domain**
  - **Addon Domain** -
  - **Parked Domain** -


- **MX-Records, Mail Exchange Records** -

- **PTR Records, Reverse DNS Record** -

- **DNS Cluster** -

- **Round Robin DNS** -
