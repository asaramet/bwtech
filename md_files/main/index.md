# The Journey

Through my journey to a Cybersecurity specialist I have to go though several steps on knowledge accumulation, if you can say so. Basically the more you know, the better; but the mind property to forget is what keeps us sane. Therefore, I've decided to document some of my findings and curiosity display for future reference. Of course it may look dumb, and some day in the future, at least I hope so, I will laugh and what I've documented and how dull it is. But it is important for me now. It shouldn't be perfect as long as it keeps me going and well documented.
