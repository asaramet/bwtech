## Network Fundamentals

Computer networks are designed to share resources and information over multiple nodes (computing devices) over a data link.
Resources can be:
- A common sharing device like a printer, which multiple clients are connected to.
- Files, images and other electronic data.

Data links can be:
- Copper cables
- Fiber optic cables
- Wireless medium  

Network Characteristics:
- Topology
- Speed
- Cost 
- Security
- Availability
- Scalability
- Reliability

##### The OSI (Open Systems Interconnect Model)
This model is an ISO standard framework that describes how devices communicate with each other over a network. The operations that are used for data transmission are spread into seven categories, namely layers, so that each layer serves the layer above and is served by the layer bellow it.

|Layer | Name         | PDU     | Includes             | Examples                                               |
|-----:|:------------:|:-------:|:--------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------|
|    7 | Application  | Data    |                      | POP3, IMAP, SMTP, HTTPS, DNS, FTP, SSH, SNMP           |
|    6 | Presentation | Data    |                      | HTML, ASCII, GIF, JPG, MPG, MOV, TLS, SSL              |
|    5 | Session      | Data    |                      | H.323 (maintain voice), NetBIOS (share files)          |
|    4 | Transport    | Segment | TCP/UDP, Port        | TCP, UDP, WAN Accelerator, Firewall, Load balancer     |
|    3 | Network      | Packet  | IP Address           | Routers, IPv4 and IPv6 Protocols, ICMP                 |
|    2 | Data Link    | Frame   | Ethernet MAC Address | Switches, NICs (Network Interface Cards), Bridges      |
|    1 | Physical     | Bit     | Bits                 | Cables, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, WAPs, Hubs, Media converters |

##### The TCP/IP Suite
A protocol stack developed by the US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the 1960s. The stack consists of multiple protocols including TCP and IP. It is also layered. Not so detailed as the OSI model, though the layers operations and functionality matches the OSI one. 

|Layer | Name           | Matches OSI Layers | Definition                                                       |
|-----:|:--------------:|:------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------:|
|    4 | Application    | 7,6,5              | Encodes and controls the messaging. Represents data users        |
|    3 | Transport      | 4                  | Communication between end devices in a network                   |
|    2 | Internet       | 3                  | Provides logical addresses and the best path through the network |
|    1 | Network Access | 2,1                | Incorporates Hardware devices and media that create the network  |


#### 1.1 Explain the role and function of network components

##### Routers

Router - a device that is able to make advanced routing decisions to direct the traffic between different areas of a network.

Firewall - secures different parts of a network from each other.
