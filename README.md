# A Blog/Docs about Networking, Server Management, Cybersecurity etc.

_The docs and articles are mainly for my own journey and future references. They may look too simplistic and duff but they are good enough and useful to me._

The **articles** are Markdown files in 'md_files' folder that are automatically converted into HTML files to create the corresponding Webpage.

## Keep it simple:
- Frontend HTML, CSS, JS.
- In Backend Node and JS when possible.
- Bash and AWK is an option.
- Python if nothing else works.
