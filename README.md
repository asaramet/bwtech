# A Blog/Docs about Networking, Server Management, Cybersecurity etc.

_The docs and articles are mainly for my own journey and future references. They may look too simplistic and duff but they are good enough and useful to me._

The **articles** are Markdown files in 'md_files' folder that are automatically converted into HTML files to create the corresponding Webpage.

## Keep it simple:
- Frontend HTML, CSS, JS.
- Bootstrap for some sweets.
- In Backend Node and JS when possible.
- Bash and AWK is an option.
- Python if nothing else works.

## How to build it:
```
$ npm run build
```
will build the './prod' folder, a collection of html, css and js files, that can be used as a Webpage Frontend. The data text for that page is converted from the Markdown files in '.md_files'.
